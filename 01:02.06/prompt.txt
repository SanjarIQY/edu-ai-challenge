hi there, I've been developing the social platform and I need to choose database which aligns with my requirements, I will provide them below, lets identify which suits best step by step. so first requirement is it need to handle with data of millions of users. second one is need to store profile, posts and connections between users. the next one is the data read speed is need to ne as fast as possible. the next one is 80 percent of the data manipulation expected to be reading and the last 20 percent writing. so last requirement is as users will grow the db also need to have scalability options
